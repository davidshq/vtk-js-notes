# Notes on The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for JavaScript (VTK.js)

# Introduction
I have the memory of a fruit fly so I write things down. This is a collection of notes on VTK.js, they are mainly here for me, but feel free to use them if you find them useful.

If you haven't ever used VTK.js before, check out the [Getting Started with VTK.js](GettingStartedWithVTK-js.md) document.
