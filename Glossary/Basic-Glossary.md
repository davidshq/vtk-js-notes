# Introduction
This Glossary covers the most basic and frequently utilized terms when working with VTK.js.

# Algorithms
- See filters.

# Annotations
- Text or graphics that are overlayed on a render.

# Filters
- Filters (also called *algorithms*) allow one to transform data in various ways.

# Objects
- Please see the [Basic Objects](Basic-Objects.md) document.

# Representations
- Representations convert the data into a visual representation.

# Slice
- A slice is a subset of a larger dataset. For example, a slice of a 3D volume is a 2D image.

# Slice Domain
- According to ChatGPT, "A slice domain...refers to the set of all possible slices that could be extracted from a dataset. It is the full range of potential slices that can be created by varying the slice criteria, such as selecting data based on a particular time range, geographica region, or some other factor."

# View
- A container for a representation.

# Visualization Pipeline
- The visualization pipeline consists of *data objects* that are passed through a series of *process objects*. May also be called the *visualization network*.

# Widgets
- Allow users to interact with the rendering, e.g. via clicking, dragging, etc.
